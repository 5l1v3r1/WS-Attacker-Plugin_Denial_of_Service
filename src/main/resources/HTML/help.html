	    <h2>Attack Success Metric</h2>
	    The definition of a successful DOS attack depends on the goal of the attacker.
	    In Order to consider different attacker goals, 2 different attack success parameters are defined:
	    <ul>
		<li>
		    <b>1. Attack roundtrip time ratio</b>
		    <br />
		    Defined as: <i>( median of response time of the last 10 tampered request ) / ( median of response time of the last 10 untampered requests )</i> 
		    <br /> 
		    The higher the ratio the higher the attack impact.
		    E.g. A ratio of 4 points indicates that the roundtrip time of the tampered request is 4 times higher than the roundtrip time of an untampered request.
		    The following threshold values are set: 
		    <table>
			<tr>
			    <td>< 3 points:</td>
			    <td>attack ineffective</td>
			</tr>   
			<tr>
			    <td>>= 3 points and < 6 points:</td>
			    <td>attack effective</td>
			</tr>  
			<tr>
			    <td>>= 6 points:</td>
			    <td>attack highly effective</td>
			</tr>  			
		    </table>
		</li>
		<li>
		    <b>2. Testprobe roundtrip time after attack</b>
		    <br />
		    Defined as: <i>( request size of testprobe request ) / ( request size of tampered request )</i> 
		    <br /> 
		    ddd
		    <table>
			<tr>
			    <td>< 2 seconds:</td>
			    <td>no or small impact on 3rd party users</td>
			</tr>   
			<tr>
			    <td>>= 2 seconds and < 5 seconds:</td>
			    <td>third party users are affected</td>
			</tr>  
			<tr>
			    <td>>= 5 seconds:</td>
			    <td>third party users are heavily affected</td>
			</tr>  			
		    </table>
		</li>
	    </ul>
	    <hr />
	    <h2>Attack Graph explained</h2>
		The result GUI is supposed to be read in the following way
		<ul>
		    <li>Green Bar: Number of untampered requests send in interval</li>
		    <li>Red Bar: Number of tampered requests send in interval</li>
		    <li>Green Line: roundtrip time of untampered requests</li>
		    <li>Red Line: roundtrip time of tampered requests</li>
		    <li>Blue Line: roundtrip time of testprobe requests <br />Simulates third party users.</li>
		</ul>    
		If more than one request got send within an interval, <br />
		the mean value of all requests that got send within that interval is calculated.

	    <h2>Architecture of the DoS extension</h2>
	    <p>
		The following process takes place once an attack was started. <br />
		The attack parameters can be set during attack configuration.
